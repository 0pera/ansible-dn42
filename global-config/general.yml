    # 172.22.108.23 is an internal IP: with iptables I do a 1-to-1 NAT from 172.23.0.53 to this
    # instead of having 172.23.0.53 directly on the loopback interface.
    # This prevents issues with martian packets: i.e. if some other network serving 172.23.0.53
    # sends traffic with that source IP through my network (usually due to asymmetric BGP paths)
    # These NAT rules are coded in roles/config-iptables/templates and triggered by a
    # pdns-recursor service override
